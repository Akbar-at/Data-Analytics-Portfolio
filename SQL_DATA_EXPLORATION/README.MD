# Data Exploration
I have done 2 explorations on different datasets. 
The first one is about a covid dataset. I explored about the percentage of people that is infected with the overall population. 
I also explored about the number of people vaccinated with a rolling count to make visualizations look better.
In the end of my exploration I created views that later will be used for data viz in Tableu

The second exploration of dataset is about power. I explored about the worlds enery source. I explored the percentage of each country energy source and classified each country 
from its main source of energy. I created VIEWS for the classification of country that later will be used for data viz in Tableu
